# sql-twitter-analysis
In this project, I have done a graph analysis to analyze Tweets from Twitter Elections Integrity Dataset.

Justice Department charged 13 Russian nationals with interfering in American electoral and political processes. The defendants worked for a well-funded “troll factory” called the Internet Research Agency(IRA).
IRA ran a campaign to sow disinformation and discord into American politics via social media (mostly twitter).
Dataset includes information from 3613 accounts believed to be connected to the Russian Internet Research Agency.

Graphical analysis has been done and page rank algorithm was used to find who has made a huge impact in this dataset.
